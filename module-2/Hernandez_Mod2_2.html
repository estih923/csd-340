<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was born in Augusta GA. But at the age of 6month moved to Costa Rica. Growing up in a hispanic culture was certainly very different than the American lifestyle. However there was many things that I liked about the culture and my childhood growing up down there.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My family consists of my wife, my son, 2 Boxer dogs, and myself. Though we are a small family unit we are all very close. We enjoy family trips to the Smoky Mountains. We try to do this as often as possible to continue making family memories.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some of my hobbies include hiking, kayaking, and playing the guitar. I have a collection of guitars that that I really enjoy. I live in Florida so we get to continue lots of outdoor activities that me and family love doing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As mentioned above living in Florida is great and been here for 23 years. Though I am not the biggest fan of the the sun I do like going to the beautiful beaches this area has to offer. I would like to do some more traveling in the future as I truly recommend anybody doing.</span></p>
