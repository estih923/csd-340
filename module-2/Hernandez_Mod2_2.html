    <h2>Chapter Title: Introduction</h2>

    <p class="intro">
        I was born in Augusta GA. But at the age of 6month moved to Costa Rica. Growing up in a hispanic culture was certainly very different than the American lifestyle. However there was many things that I liked about the culture and my childhood growing up down there.

        My family consists of my wife, my son, 2 Boxer dogs, and myself. Though we are a small family unit we are all very close. We enjoy family trips to the Smoky Mountains. We try to do this as often as possible to continue making family memories.

        Some of my hobbies include hiking, kayaking, and playing the guitar. I have a collection of guitars that that I really enjoy. I live in Florida so we get to continue lots of outdoor activities that me and family love doing.

        As mentioned above living in Florida is great and been here for 23 years. Though I am not the biggest fan of the the sun I do like going to the <span class="sentence">beautiful beaches this area has to offer.</span> I would like to do some more traveling in the future as I truly recommend anybody doing.
